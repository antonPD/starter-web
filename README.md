# Starter Web Repo

This repository is for showing how Git and GitHub work.
You shouldn't think this is going to help you much, though.
It might be fun, though.

## Introduction
This example is to show different parts of the Git repository and various commands using a web project.

## Purpose

Sample website with plenty of files for demos. Demos, too!
We'll learn things along the way, like rebasing.
Then we'll add the changes from `myfeature` branch.

## Deployment
Deployment can be done of any web server.
